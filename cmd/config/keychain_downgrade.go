func NewCmdConfigKeychainDowngrade(f *cmdutil.Factory) *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "keychain-downgrade",
		Short: "Downgrade keychain storage to a local file (macOS only)",
		Long: `Materialize the master key from the macOS system Keychain into a local file
under ~/Library/Application Support/lark-cli/master.key.file, then pin all
subsequent reads to that file.

Intended workflow: run this once from an interactive Terminal session on
macOS (where the system Keychain is reachable). After it finishes,
sandboxed / automation / CI runs of work-cli on the same machine will read
the master key from the local file and no longer need the OS Keychain.

This is the supported fix for environments like the Codex sandbox where the
system Keychain is blocked. Running keychain-downgrade from inside such a
sandbox will itself fail with "keychain access blocked" — that is expected;
run it from an interactive macOS session instead.

The OS Keychain entry is preserved as a cold backup; nothing is deleted there.
The command is idempotent: re-running it on an already-downgraded install
reports "already downgraded" and exits 0.`,
